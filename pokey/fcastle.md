**Description:**
The Forbidden castle is an ominous, randomly generated structure, considered to be the most challenging because of the well-trained Piglins inhabiting the place. Those Piglins are capable of everything to protect their territory and more importantly, their precious loot and weapons. The Forbidden castle is generated in a logical but random way, with fortified walls and towers protecting the fort you can enter through an entrance and court, but all possible pieces of the castle cannot spawn at the same time, meaning some rooms and the loot that comes with it might be missing from one Forbidden castle to another.
